Accurate Cyber Defense Origami Framework is a simplified, layered cybersecurity framework designed to help organizations build strong, adaptive, and efficient defenses.
Inspired by origami, it focuses on folding security controls into clear, structured layers such as network security, application protection, data security, monitoring, and incident response. The framework emphasizes accuracy, visibility, and continuous improvement, allowing teams to detect threats early and respond effectively. It supports open-source tools, automation, and best practices for penetration testing, threat monitoring, and risk management. Suitable for education, small enterprises, and critical infrastructure environments, the framework promotes practical, scalable, and resilient cyber defense strategies.
